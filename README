ll-build is a script I wrote to create a number of KVM guests to
test/demo technologies on my laptop.

The ll-build script currently creates three KVM guests from the RHEL
DVD ISO image:

 * an IPA server
 * a Red Hat Subscription Asset Manager server
 * a cobbler server

You should be able to PXE boot new guests from the cobbler server on
the private network that is created on your laptop.

ll-build requires a few things before you start:

1. You'll need an RHN account and a RHEL DVD ISO image.

2. You should create an RHN Classic Activation Key for RHEL and the
 SAM server.  Point your browser here:
 https://rhn.redhat.com/network/account/activation_keys/list.pxt 
 Now create a new Activation Key with the Red Hat Default base channel,
 and the "SAM for RHEL Server (v.6 64-bit x86_64)" child channel.

3. You'll need to allocate some entitlements to your SAM server and
   download a manifest file (manifest.zip) from access.redhat.com.

4. You'll need a public ssh key for the default user account.

5. You'll need to set up a private network for libvirt managed
guests.  Drop the following file in
/etc/libvirt/qemu/networks/10_0.xml :

    <network>
      <name>10_0</name>
      <uuid>fc760627-1490-3fa4-7719-7b40a1c48f65</uuid>
      <forward mode='nat'/>
      <bridge name='atg0' stp='on' forwardDelay='0' ></bridge>
      <ip address='10.0.0.1' netmask='255.255.255.0'>
        <dhcp>
          <range start='10.0.0.100' end='10.0.0.254' ></range>
        </dhcp>
      </ip>
    </network>

Now do this...

    cd /etc/libvirt/qemu/networks/autostart/
    ln -s ../10_0.xml .

That's it.


ll-build requires that you set a number of environment variables to
configure the system.  They are documented at the top of the script.
You can either modify the script to change these values, or create a
~/.ll-config file to set all of the values.   Here's an example...
